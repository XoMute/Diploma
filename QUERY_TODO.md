- Error when empty query
- Implement semantic errors
* No more than one dot in a row
* No dot after empty array or sliced array (dot only on object or array?)
* Error if nothing after comma
* No more than one array braces in a row
* Dot HAS to be present between different parts (`.[0]foo` is incorrect but possible atm.)
* Field name must be preceeded with dot
* TODO
- Array creation of elements
- Object creation of given fields
